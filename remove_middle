# Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.

# The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.

# For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:

# Slice the list twice to get the first half and the last half of the list. Then combine them using +.

# The first half of the list should be lst[:start]

# Write your function here
def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
  if start < len(lst):
    one_step = lst[:start]
  if end <= len(lst):
    two_step = lst[end+1:]
  return one_step + two_step
  

# Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))
